# Fleet-of-Vehicles

In-class assignment 9
Fleet of Vehicles
Objective:
Use classes and inheritance to create a vehicle system managing system.
Lab Solution
Requirements:
• Functionality. (80pts)
o No Syntax Errors. (80pts*)
§ *Code that cannot be compiled due to syntax errors is
nonfunctional code and will receive no points for this entire
section.
o Set-Up the Project (5pts)
§ Include the tester code in your project.
§ Do not alter the provided code.
o Write a class file called Vehicle
§ Instance Variables
• Manufacturer’s name: a non-null String that represents
the manufacturer of the vehicle. Default value is
“none”.
• Number of Cylinders: a non-zero, positive whole
number value representing the number of cylinders.
Default value is 6.
• Owner’s name: a non-null String that represents the
owner’s name of the vehicle. Default value is “none”.
§ Constructors
• Default: Must set all properties to their default values
mentioned in the “Instance Variables” section.
• Parameterized: Must take in a parameter for each
instance variable in the order named above. This means
the first instance variable is the first parameter, the
second instance variable is the second parameter, and so
on. This must set the instance variable values only if the
given values are valid, but otherwise it must set the
instance variables to their default values.
§ Methods
• Accessors and Mutators for the instance variables
o Make sure in the mutators check for valid values
named in the “Instance Variables” Section.
o If the value that is being set is not valid, then set
the instance variable to its default value.
• Equals: This method takes in another instance of
Vehicle and only returns true if all of the instance
variables match.
• ToString: This method returns a String with all of the
instance variable values concatenated together with the
format:
Manufacturer’s Name: <<Manufacturer’s Name>>\n
Number of Cylinders: <<Number of Cylinders>>\n
Owner’s Name: <<Owner’s Name>>\n
Where values in “<<>>” correspond to the
instance variable values.
§ All above must apply for full credit.
o Write a class file called Truck that inherits from Vehicle
§ Instance Variables
• Load Capacity: A non-negative decimal value that
represents number of tons the Truck can handle. Default
value is 1.0.
• Towing Capacity: A non-negative decimal value that
represents the number of tons the Truck can move.
Default value is 1.0.
§ Constructors
• Default: Must set all properties to their default values
mentioned in the “Instance Variables” section.
o Must also set Vehicle’s Default values as well.
• Parameterized: Must take in a parameter for each
instance variable in Vehicle and THEN Truck in the
orders named above. This means the first instance
variable is the first parameter, the second instance
variable is the second parameter, and so on. This must
set the instance variable values only if the given values
are valid, but otherwise it must set the instance variables
to their default values.
o Must also set Vehicle’s Parameterized values as
well.
§ Methods
• Accessors and Mutators for the instance variables
o Make sure in the mutators check for valid values
named in the “Instance Variables” Section.
o If the value that is being set is not valid, then set
the instance variable to its default value.
• Equals: This method takes in another instance of Truck
and only returns true if all of the instance variables,
both Vehicle and Truck, match.
• ToString: This method returns a String with all of the
instance variable values concatenated together with the
format:
Manufacturer’s Name: <<Manufacturer’s Name>>\n
Number of Cylinders: <<Number of Cylinders>>\n
Owner’s Name: <<Owner’s Name>>\n
Towing Capacity: <<Towing Capacity>>\n
Load Capacity: <<Load Capacity>>\n
Where values in “<<>>” correspond to the
instance variable values.
§ All above must apply for full credit.
o Write a class file called Car that inherits from Vehicle
§ Instance Variables
• Gas Mileage: A non-negative decimal value that
represents number of gallons of gas per mile. Default
value is 1.0.
• Number of Passengers: A non-negative whole number
value that represents the number of passengers the car
can contain. Default value is 1.
§ Constructors
• Default: Must set all properties to their default values
mentioned in the “Instance Variables” section.
o Must also set Vehicle’s Default values as well.
• Parameterized: Must take in a parameter for each
instance variable in Vehicle and THEN Car in the
orders named above. This means the first instance
variable is the first parameter, the second instance
variable is the second parameter, and so on. This must
set the instance variable values only if the given values
are valid, but otherwise it must set the instance variables
to their default values.
o Must also set Vehicle’s Parameterized values as
well.
§ Methods
• Accessors and Mutators for the instance variables
o Make sure in the mutators check for valid values
named in the “Instance Variables” Section.
o If the value that is being set is not valid, then set
the instance variable to its default value.
• Equals: This method takes in another instance of Car
and only returns true if all of the instance variables,
both Vehicle and Car, match.
• ToString: This method returns a String with all of the
instance variable values concatenated together with the
format:
Manufacturer’s Name: <<Manufacturer’s Name>>\n
Number of Cylinders: <<Number of Cylinders>>\n
Owner’s Name: <<Owner’s Name>>\n
Gas Mileage: <<Gas Mileage>>\n
Number of Passengers: <<Number of Passengers>>\n
Where values in “<<>>” correspond to the
instance variable values.
§ All above must apply for full credit.
